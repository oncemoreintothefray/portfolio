This project works on the New York Rainfall Data from 1920-2019 as published by La Guardia NY.

This simple animated visualization gives users the option to filter Rainfall Data based on Decade wise level of Aggregation
with the size of the marks representing the amount of rainfall.

The visualization can be found at Tableau Public on:
